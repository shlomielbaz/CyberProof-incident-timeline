1). In both folders (server and client) you should run npm install first!
2). run the server - inside "server" folder execute: npm start.
3). run the client - inside "client" folder execute: npm start.
4). open browser with URL: http://localhost:4200/ and peak one from the list or go to specific one http://localhost:4200/incident/some number 1 to 7.
5). start to change status, priority, country and etc.<br /><br />


## Proxy
The client app connect to the server throgh proxy configurations (proxy.conf.json), so the "relative" URL's such as '/api/incident/' is actually connect to: http://localhost:3000/api/incident/ (external URL)<br /><br />
